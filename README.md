# One-shot-SSVEP-classification
This is the official implementation for "OS-SSVEP: One-shot SSVEP classification". This study addresses the significant challenge of developing efficient decoding algorithms for classifying steady-state visual evoked potentials (SSVEPs) in scenarios characterized by extreme scarcity of calibration data, where only one calibration is available for each stimulus target.
